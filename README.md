# s1_m1_face_roi_masks
ROI Masks for the somatotopic face areas of primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex based on MNI coordinates reported by Roux et al. 2018 and 2020. 

Mean MNI coordinates for body-part specific responses were determined via electrostimulation by Roux et al. 2018 (S1) and 2020 (M1).  
We generated 4mm spheres around the mean coordinates reported for each distinct body part; these spheres were then organized into body region groups and added to create the composite ROI. 
The mean MNI coordinates for individual body parts are listed below under the composite M1 or S1 region in which they were included.  
The .nii files included in this responsitory contain the ROI masks for each of these composite regions as constructed using FSL. 

For any questions about the development or application of this ROI set please contact: kimberly.s.bress@vanderbilt.edu.
